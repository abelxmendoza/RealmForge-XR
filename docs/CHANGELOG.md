# Changelog

All notable changes to RealmForge XR are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
Dates are UTC.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Creative Studio** (`?studio=1`, local dev server only): personal image-to-3D library. Import artwork (originals kept read-only), non-destructive prep (crop, plain-background removal, trim/pad, downsize) with server-side subject checks, a ProjectSim Standard dry run with cost/budget preview, typed human approval plus a server spend switch, a GLB conversion gate, a model viewer (orbit/zoom/pan/reset, wireframe, grid, lighting, background, bounds, screenshot) and a gallery of CC-BY-4.0 projectsim samples. No credits spent. Docs: `docs/creative-studio/`.

### Fixed

- Docs/examples cleanup: demo readiness reflects `main`; stale “do not merge Quest” / missing XR confirm notes removed; XR menu example points at production palette + confirmation.
- Voice spawn for event `prop` objects: requires `catalogId`, wired through `propFromCatalog`; venue phrases (booth, registration desk, stage, …).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-10-17

### Added

- Quest XR on `main`: hand grab, scale presets, wrist menu, Place city, rays/surface, `/xr-test/`.
- Environments menu (Forge / Mars / Warehouse); world persistence + undo/redo.
- Immersive control palette with in-headset Confirm/Cancel.
- Molten-forge theme shared across landing, desktop HUD, wrist menu, VR palette.
- User & controls guide (web **Guide** / **?** and VR Guide panel).
- AssemblyAI voice commands + floating mic / VR voice tile; multi-actor controls.
- Desktop right-click world actions menu; asset catalog / warehouse destinations.

### Notes

- Physical Quest hardware checklist remains with Emiliano (`docs/demo-readiness.md`).
