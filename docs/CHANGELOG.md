# Changelog

All notable changes to RealmForge XR are documented here.
Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).
Dates are UTC.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Editor HUD adapts to the device: **Enter XR** only shows where the browser supports AR or VR (VR-only headsets get VR instead of an error), **Place world** only with AR, and devices without a headset get **Open on Quest** (copies the editor link).
- Robot status says what to do next ("No destination yet · Plan Routes → Add Waypoint") and only counts replans once there are some.
- Wall and Road / Platform stay armed after each one, like the other Build tools; **Done placing** or 1 returns to Select.
- Touch-friendly side panel copy; the right-click tip only shows with a mouse.

### Fixed

- Phone layout: the status pill no longer overlaps the side panel when the menu is open (it now shows under the folded top bar).

- Docs/examples cleanup: demo readiness reflects `main`; stale “do not merge Quest” / missing XR confirm notes removed; XR menu example points at production palette + confirmation.
- Voice spawn for event `prop` objects: requires `catalogId`, wired through `propFromCatalog`; venue phrases (booth, registration desk, stage, …).

## [0.2.0] — 2026-10-17

### Added

- Quest XR on `main`: hand grab, scale presets, wrist menu, Place city, rays/surface, `/xr-test/`.
- Environments menu (Forge / Mars / Warehouse); world persistence + undo/redo.
- Immersive control palette with in-headset Confirm/Cancel.
- Molten-forge theme shared across landing, desktop HUD, wrist menu, VR palette.
- User & controls guide (web **Guide** / **?** and VR Guide panel).
- AssemblyAI voice commands + floating mic / VR voice tile; multi-actor controls.
- Desktop right-click world actions menu; asset catalog / warehouse destinations.

### Notes

- Physical Quest hardware checklist remains with Emiliano (`docs/demo-readiness.md`).
- Live mic needs dotenvx private key; ElevenLabs not implemented.

### Added

- App scaffold: world store, grid A* navigation, robot, pointer editor (desktop + XR rays).
- Worldbuilding kinds: wall, building, platform, tree, streetlight, crate; materials and styles.
- Forge District preset; inspector panel; map-grid snapping; demo “block route”.
- Encrypted shared env via dotenvx.
- Standalone `/xr-test/` passthrough page; Quest 2 testing guide; cloudflared host allowlist.
